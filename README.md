## Graduation Formatting

### Introduction

This is a Microsoft Word template for the graduation paper from Tsinghua University in 2019. Well, writing is pleasant while typesetting is always painful especially with pdf transferred from Latex not well supported by the duplication checking system, nor does an applicable Latex template provided. This project aims to free you of the disgusting and awkward procedure and enable you to head directly to the paper.

### Usage

Just open the `.docx` file and edit!

### Additional Information

#### Font

The compulsory typeface, type size and font type are different between Chinese Simplified and English. The confusing perspective is the distinction between "字号" and "point type (pt)" and it is the reason why I separate some font styles by Chinese Simplified and English. The unit transfers according to the following table:

| Font Size | Point Type (pt) |
| --------- | --------------- |
| 初号      | 42              |
| 小初      | 36              |
| 一号      | 26              |
| 小一      | 24              |
| 二号      | 22              |
| 小二      | 18              |
| 三号      | 16              |
| 小三      | 15              |
| 四号      | 14              |
| 小四      | 12              |
| 五号      | 10.5            |
| 小五      | 9               |
| 六号      | 7.5             |
| 小六      | 6.5             |
| 七号      | 5.5             |
| 八号      | 5               |

#### License and Rights

I erased the author list in the Word file information for your convenience for successive modification. Therefore, when you edit the `.docx` file, DO NOT forget to first add your own Microsoft account as the author of the file. This can be done by changing the author list in `File -> Info ` .
